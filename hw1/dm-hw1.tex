	\section*{Problem 1}\label{sec:prob-1}
	\configuratedText{	
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item 	I choose the probability space such that each element in $\Omega$ corresponds to a unique ordering of the cards in the deck.\\
	Mathematically, $\Omega = \{\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3, \ldots, \sigma_{52!}\}$, where each $\sigma_i$ is a distinct permutation.\\
	Since each permutation in $\Omega$ is equally likely when we shuffle a standard deck of cards, we have a uniform probability distribution.\\
	The probability measure $P$ assigns equal probabilities to all permutations in $\Omega$. Therefore, for any event $A \subseteq \Omega$, we have:\\
	\[P(A) = \frac{|A|}{52!}\]\\
	Specifically, for each individual permutation $\sigma_i$ in $\Omega$:\\
	\[P(\sigma_i) = \frac{1}{52!}\]
	\item 	Probability of the each event is:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Finding the probability that the first two cards include at least one ace}
	
	We can use the complement rule:
	\[ \text{Probability (at least one ace in the first two cards)} =\]
	\[ 1 - \text{ Probability (no aces in the first two cards)} \]
	
	Now, let's calculate the probability of not getting any aces in the first two cards. There are 52 cards in the deck initially, and 48 of them are not aces. When we pick the first card, there are 48 non-ace cards out of 52 possibilities. After picking the first card, there are now 51 cards left in the deck, with 47 of them being non-ace cards. Therefore, the probability of not getting an ace on the second card, given that the first card was not an ace, is:
	\[ \frac{48}{52} \cdot \frac{47}{51} \]
	
	So, the probability that the first two cards contain at least one ace is:
	\[ 1 - \left( \frac{48}{52} \cdot \frac{47}{51} \right) \approx 0.1494 \]
	
	\item \textbf{Finding the probability that the first five cards include at least one ace}
	
	Same as item (a) we can use the complement rule:
	\[ \text{Probability (at least one ace in the first five cards)} =\]
	\[ 1 - \text{ Probability (no aces in the first five cards)} \]
	
	Same as previous item, the probability of not getting an ace on the first 5 cards, is:
	\[ \frac{48}{52} \cdot \frac{47}{51} \cdot \frac{46}{50} \cdot \frac{45}{49} \cdot \frac{44}{28}\]
	
	So, the probability that the first five cards include at least one ace:
	\[ 1 - \left(\frac{48}{52} \cdot \frac{47}{51} \cdot \frac{46}{50} \cdot \frac{45}{49} \cdot \frac{44}{28} \right) \approx 0.3147 \]
	
	\item \textbf{The first two cards are a pair of the same rank}\\
	To find the probability that the first two cards drawn from a standard deck are a pair of the same rank, you can approach it as follows:
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item There are 52 cards in a standard deck.
	\item For the first card, there are no restrictions, so there are 52 possibilities.
	\item For the second card, you want it to be of the same rank as the first card, which means there are 3 cards of the same rank left in the deck (since there are 4 cards of each rank in a standard deck, and you've already drawn one).
	\end{itemize}
	
	So, the probability of drawing a pair of the same rank for the first two cards is:
	
	\begin{align*}
	\text{Probability} &= \frac{52/52 \cdot 3/51}{1} = \frac{1}{17}
	\end{align*}
	
	So, the probability of drawing the first two cards as a pair of the same rank is $1/17 \approx 0.0588 $.
	
	\item \textbf{The first five cards are all diamonds.}
	
	There are 13 diamonds in a standard deck.
	
	The probability of drawing a diamond on the first draw is $ \frac{13}{52} $ because there are 13 diamonds out of 52 cards.
	
	Similarly, for the second, third, fourth, and fifth draws, the probabilities are as follows:
	
	Second draw: $ \frac{12}{51} $\\
	Third draw: $ \frac{11}{50} $\\
	Fourth draw: $ \frac{10}{49} $\\
	Fifth draw: $ \frac{9}{48} $\\
	
	Because these are independent events, we can multiply these probabilities together:
	\[ \frac{13}{52} \cdot \frac{12}{51} \cdot \frac{11}{50} \cdot \frac{10}{49} \approx 0.00018184\]
	
	So, the probability of drawing the first five cards as diamonds is approximately 0.00018184, or about 0.0182\%.
	
	\item \textbf{The first five cards form a full house}\\
	There are ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ different ways to choose 3 cards of the same type and ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ different ways to choose 2 cards of the same type. To get a full house, you need to first pick the type of the 3 of a kind, which is ${13 \choose 1} = 13$ different choices, and choose the type of the pair, which is ${12 \choose 1} = 12$ different choices. The order does not count, so there are ${13 \choose 1} \cdot {4 \choose 3} \cdot {12 \choose 1} \cdot {4 \choose 2}$ ways to have a full house.
	
	\[
	{13 \choose 1} \cdot {4 \choose 3} \cdot {12 \choose 1} \cdot {4 \choose 2} = 3744
	\]
	
	Note that there are ${52 \choose 5} = 2,598,960$ different combinations for the first 5 cards, so the probability of being dealt a full house is:
	
	\[
	\frac{3744}{2,598,960} \approx 0.14\%
	\]
	
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
	}

	\newpage
	\section*{Problem 2}\label{sec:prob-2}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item For calculating the probability that the baby born at midnight was a boy I design the following probability space:
	 let's define $ E_{1} $ and $ E_{2} $ as following:
	 
	 $ b $: Number of boys before midnight (In our case 4)
	 
	 $ g $: Number of girls before midnight
	 
	 $ E_{1} $: boy is born at midnight
	 
	 $ E_{2} $: girl is born at midnight\\
	
	Let say that initially there were $ n $ girls.
	
	$ B $: boy picked up by nurse
	
	$ G $: girl picked up by nurse\\
	
	\item We have to calculate $ P(E_{1}|B) $:
	
	\[
	P(E_{1}|B) = \frac{P(E_{1} \cap B)}{P(B)}
	\]
	
	\textbf{Assumption}: I assumed, when a child is born, the probability of that child being either a boy or a girl is 50\%
	
	The chance of picking a boy, which we'll call P(B), is calculated by adding together the probability of picking a boy such that the boy was born at midnight and the probability of picking a boy such that the girl was born at midnight.
	
	\[
	P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot P(B|E_{1}) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot P(B|E_{2}) 
	\]
	\[
	P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b + 1}{b + 1 + g} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b}{b + 1 + g} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2b + 1}{b + 1 + g}
	\]\\
	
	As $ P(E_{1} \cap B) $ = $ P(B \cap E_{1}) $, and  $ P(B \cap E_{1}) $ = $ P(B | E_{1}) \cdot  P(E_{1}) \dots$
	
	\[
	P(E_{1}|B) = \frac{P(B | E_{1}) \cdot  P(E_{1})}{P(B)}
	\]
	
	So,
	
	\[
	P(E_{1}|B) = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{b + 1}{b + 1 + g}}{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2b + 1}{b + 1 + g}} = \frac{b + 1}{2b + 1} = \frac{5}{9} \approx 0.56
	\]
	
	\end{enumerate}

	\newpage
	\section*{Problem 3}\label{sec:prob-3}
	Let's define the following probability space for this problem:
	
	$ n $: Number of times your roll three dices
	
	$ E_{11} $ : Sum is 11
	
	$ E_{16} $ : Sum is 16

	$ E_{11}^{C} $ : Sum is not 11
	
	$ E_{16}^{C} $ : Sum is not 16\\
		
	Let's simulate some numbers of rolling times and calculate the possible outcomes to gain an insight:
	
	\[
	n = 1 \rightarrow
	\begin{cases}
	E_{11}^{1}  & P(E_{11}) = \frac{18}{216}\\
	E_{16}^{1}  & P(E_{16}) = \frac{6}{216 }\\
	(E_{11}^{1} \textit{ and } E_{16}^{1})^{C}  & P(E_{11}^{C} \cup E_{16}^{C}) = \frac{195}{216 }
	\end{cases}
	\]

	\[
	n = 2 \xrightarrow[\text{in n = 1}]{\text{Sum was not 11 not 16}}
	\begin{cases}
	E_{11}^{2}  & P(E_{11}) = \frac{195}{216 } \cdot \frac{18}{216}  \\
	E_{16}^{2}  & P(E_{16}) = \frac{195}{216 } \cdot \frac{6}{216 } \\
	(E_{11}^{2} \textit{ and } E_{16}^{2})^{C} & P(E_{11}^{C} \cup E_{16}^{C}) = \frac{195}{216 } \cdot \frac{195}{216 }
	\end{cases}
	\]

	\[
	n = 3 \xrightarrow[\text{not n = 1 nor in n = 2}]{\text{Sum was not 11 not 16}}
	\begin{cases}
	E_{11}^{3}  & P(E_{11}) = \frac{195}{216 } \cdot \frac{195}{216 } \cdot \frac{18}{216}  \\
	E_{16}^{3}  & P(E_{16}) = \frac{195}{216 } \cdot \frac{195}{216 } \cdot \frac{6}{216 } \\
	(E_{11}^{3} \textit{ and } E_{16}^{3})^{C} & P(E_{11}^{C} \cup E_{16}^{C}) = \frac{195}{216 } \cdot \frac{195}{216 } \cdot \frac{195}{216 }
	\end{cases}
	\]\\
	
	So, we found a trend!
	
	The probability that you stop because you see a sum of 16 in the $ n^{th} $ time is:
	\[
	P(E_{16})^{n} = P(E_{11}^{C} \cup E_{16}^{C})^{n-1} \cdot P(E_{16})
	\]
	
	Which will be:
	\[
	P(E_{16})^{n} = (\frac{195}{216})^{n-1} \cdot \frac{6}{216}
	\]

	\section*{Problem 4}\label{sec:prob-4}
	To find the expectation of X, we need to calculate the average number of times the word ``mining'' appears in a randomly typed sequence of $100,000,000,000$ letters.\\
	
	The word ``mining'' consists of $6$ letters, and each letter has an equal probability of being typed by the monkey. So, the probability of the monkey typing the word ``mining'' in a specific order is $\left(\frac{1}{26}\right)^6$.\\
	
	Now, let's calculate the number of possible positions where the word ``mining'' can start in a sequence of $100,000,000,000$ letters. Since there are $100,000,000,000 - 6 + 1 = 99,999,999,995$ possible starting positions, the probability of the monkey typing the word ``mining'' in any of these positions is $99,999,999,995 \left(\frac{1}{26}\right)^6$.\\
	
	To find the expectation of X, we multiply the probability of the monkey typing the word ``mining'' in any given position by the total number of possible starting positions:
	
	\[
	\text{Expectation of } X = 99,999,999,995 \left(\frac{1}{26}\right)^6
	\]
	
	Let's calculate this value:
	
	\[
	\text{Expectation of } X = 99,999,999,995 \left(\frac{1}{26}\right)^6
	\]
	\[
	\text{Expectation of } X \approx 99,999,999,995 \times 3.2371e^{-9}
	\]
	\[
	\text{Expectation of } X \approx 323.71
	\]
	
	Therefore, the expectation of $X$, the number of times the word ``mining'' appears, is approximately $323.71$.
	
	\newpage
	\section*{Problem 5}\label{sec:prob-5}
	To find the probability of seeing a bicycle in a given time interval, we can assume that the probability of seeing a bicycle remains constant over time. 
	
	We already know the probability of seeing a bicycle in 45 minutes as P(45), which is 97\%. We want to find the probability of seeing a bicycle in a 15-minute interval, written as P(15).
	
	Since the probability remains constant, we can assume that the ratio of probabilities is the same as the ratio of time intervals:
	
	\[
	\frac{{P(15)}}{{P(45)}} = \frac{{15}}{{45}}\]
	
	To find P(15), we can rearrange the equation:
	
	\[P(15) = \frac{{15}}{{45}} \times P(45)\]
	
	Substituting the given value of P(45) as 97\% or 0.97:
	
	\[P(15) = \frac{{15}}{{45}} \times 0.97\]
	
	Calculating this expression:
	
	\[P(15) = 0.32\]
	
	Therefore, the probability of seeing a bicycle in a 15-minute interval is 32\%.

	\section*{Problem 7}\label{sec:prob-7}
	For this problem a console program based on two libraries:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item 	\textit{requests} Python library $ \rightarrow $ DirectAPIClient.py
	\item 	\textit{meteomatics.api} library $ \rightarrow $ HighLevelAPIClient.py
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection*{Retrieving Data Using DirectAPIClient Class}
	The \texttt{DirectAPIClient} class retrieves weather data from the Meteomatics API through the following steps:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item It formats the time range for the query using the provided start date, end date, and interval.
	\item The API URL is constructed by combining the base URL, time range, selected parameters, coordinates (latitude and longitude), and specifying the output format as JSON.
	\item An HTTP GET request is sent to the constructed API URL, including your Meteomatics API username and password for authentication.
	\item The response from the API is captured and checked for its status code.
	\item In the case of a successful response (status code 200), the function parses the JSON response and extracts the weather data.
	\item The weather data is processed to obtain time series for each selected parameter.
	\item A Plotly figure is created, with traces (lines) added for each parameter to visualize trends over time.
	\item The function includes error handling for errors based on the given HTTP status codes and provides informative error messages.
	\item Also exception handling is implemented to catch any unexpected exceptions during the process.
	\item The Plotly figure is displayed, allowing users to analyze and visualize the weather data.
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection*{How to Use The Program}
	
	\configuratedText{Run Python Main.py
	
	Follow the prompts to select parameters, input dates and time intervals, and choose either the high-level or direct API client.
	
	The program will then query the Meteomatics API, retrieve weather data, and display it as a Plotly graph.
	
	You can visualize and analyze the trends of the selected weather parameters over a any time period that you want.}
